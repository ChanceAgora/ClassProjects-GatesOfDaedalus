This is a project game for a college class dealing with the Object Oriented Paradigm. The instruction was to create a text based game through the use of objects and object behavior (i.e. polymorphism, inheritance, etc.)

The source directory contains the raw java code in an uncompiled format. 

The data directory contains .csv files that hold character, map and item data. 

The Makefile has been created in such a  way that typing make in a terminal whose current working directory is the root will create a new folder entitled compiled containing the compiled code. 

The main program is contained in Adventure; hence, this is the file that should be run in order to play the game. All other files are auxiliary and should not be run directly.
