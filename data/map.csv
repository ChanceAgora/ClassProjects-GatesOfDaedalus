0,0,HQ,You stand in the lobby of the Kalipolis. It is a grand entry room for the forward operating base of the Temporal Anomaly Bureau (TAB.) Only here are the strands of time grasped and untangled by the hands of man. To the south is a small exit that leads to a bustling city street.,0,1,0,0
0,1,City Street,You stand on the north side of a bustling avenue. Cars whip past continuously; a much faster–though no less abundant–stream as compared to the pedestrians. To the east lies a set of stairs leading downward into a dim cavern; the sound of trains stopping and going roars up every so often. To the north a grand set of hotel doors house the TAB's HQ. There is also a small bakery to the south.,1,1,1,0
0,2,Small Bakery,It smells wonderfully of cinnamon and coffee. There is a counter with glass shelving of pastries and snacks. You can't be sure... but there's a strange device–small and discrete–that seems to be laying on a shelf behind the counter. You can't reach it though. It’s empty in here except for the handful of customers mingling about. To your north there’s a large door leading onto the street.,1,0,0,0
1,1,Urbe Station,Around you the frantic motion of a crowd rushes to and from the platforms. Every person seems to move as if they are running late. To the west are a set of stairs leading upwards into bright blue skylight. You can also board the train to your east. Tucked back in a corner to the south you think you see a small door reading "Manager's Office.",0,1,1,1
1,2,Subway Office,There is a mess of papers sitting on a desk here. The stack is cartoonish in its height. The walls are decorated with paintings prominently displaying the same farmhouse from different angles. Through the small door to the north you hear the sound of rushing trains.,1,0,0,0
2,0,Weathered Farmhouse,It’s a quiet and peaceful room. There is a candle burning on the coffee table before you making present the gentle aroma of cedar and cinnamon. The floor is clean wood; gentle under your boots. To the south there is a door; through the door’s window you can see a porch that leads to a path which trails off to the horizon. East of you sits a small wooden door slightly ajar. You can just glimspe a bedframe through the crack.,0,1,1,0
2,1,Agra Station,The platforms here are lightly dotted with rural-dressed men and women. Behind you the trains come and go–often taking people in but rarely letting passengers off. It’s strange that the station never seems to run low on patrons. There is a cobbled path leading north towards a small town and a path to the east leading into hills. You can also board the train to your west.,1,0,1,1
3,0,The Farmhouse Bedroom,In this room sits a solitary bed. It’s wooden frame is splotchy and faded. To the east is a door back to the main farmhouse room.,0,0,0,1
3,1,Corn Maze,It is hard to breathe. The walls of the maze press in around you. Where? Where is the way out? You can feel your heart begin to race...,0,1,0,1
3,2,Bunker Entrance,You find yourself standing beside a heavy steel hatch. Its surface is etched with the marks of age. It lies in the dirt–upside down and open. Through a dark whole in the ground east of you see a ladder climbing down into an endless cavern. To the north is a field of corn. You see a vague path through trees running off to the south.,1,1,1,0
3,3,Stone Circle,You are standing in a large field. It is empty save for a circle of stones in the center. The stones are massive and heavy things that couldn’t be moved by ten men; each is no less than 7 or 8 feet tall. Yet the circle is well defined and deliberate. To the north is an opening in the trees.,1,0,0,0
4,2,Room of Computers,This room is filled with desks. Each is adorned with a large computer monitor. The images displayed on the monitors are all different. Some show satellites views of houses while others display data tables and charts. Etched into the west wall is a ladder leading up. There is a door inset into the stone wall to the east which seems to lead to a small room. To the south there’s a hole in the wall that’s filled with darkness.,0,1,1,1
4,3,Pile of Rubble,Smashed pieces of debris litter the floor. There is a great hole in the eastern portion of the floor here. Inside you see a cockpit–at least it looks like a cockpit–and two seats. There is no steering wheel or control yoke but instead a display reading 3014 in bold letters with an array of various data control buttons to the right. To your north is a hole in the wall through which you see the room of computers.,1,0,1,0
4,4,Gates of Daedalus,A great spinning disc floating above a silver pedestal. Its edges are blurred and it almost seems not to move at all—its speed so great you can barely see the change in its surface. There is an engraving here on the pedestal that reads NOLI ALTUM NIMIS VOLARE. To the east is an archway leading to a much smaller room.,0,0,1,0
5,2,Satelite Matrix,This room is a mess of wires which are all tangled together across the floor and ceiling alike. In the center of the room there’s a large device that looks like a radar dish. It’s aimed upwards and humming loudly. To the west is a door through which you see desks stacked with monitors.,0,0,0,1
5,3,Strange Cockpit,The seat you have taken is very comfortable. It seems to be made from a fine leather. The computer screen is much more visible here. It displays the numbers 3014. To the right of the number there is a table counting a large amount of data. It seems to represent the date March 3 of 3014. In addition there is a location label that reads Madisonville. On the side of the capsule’s interior is an inscription that reads Tempori tuus est. From here you can climb upwards and westwards into the room above. There is also a button that reads EMBARK on the display which you may be able to click. It's just a little to far east of you on the other end of the cockpit. You may be able to reach it if you move...,0,0,1,1
5,4,Entryway,This is a finely adorned entryway. You can hear a constant but gentle hum coming from the room to the west through a massive archway which reveals a large gold and marble room. To the east is a gate leading outside. Eastward is a set of engraved marble doors leading onto a street.,0,0,1,1
6,3,HQ,You recall only a flash of light and rapid increase in G-force. Then... It's a blur. It is only clear to you now where you were–where you've been is lost to you. You stand in the lobby of the Kalipolis. Yet it is not the same as you know it. The soft velvet floors have been exchanged for a sleek tile-like material. It is pleasant under your boots. South of you lies a door leading to somewhere filled with fog and mist.,0,1,0,0
6,4,City Street,This is not the city street you know. No. Off the sidewalk you see a great drop to the earth—thousands of feet below. There are no cars flying past; only the persistent whisper of high-altitude wind. There is nobody. There is a bridge stretching out over what looks like water far below to your east. There is also an larch archway to the west that leads into a marble building adorned with color.,1,0,1,1
7,4,Sky Bridge,There is nothing here but a vastness below. High over head marble pillars stretch upwards towards the Sun. A pillar at the end of the bridge is smeared with red graffiti. It reads "WE ARE NOT IN CONTROL—LEAVE AND DO NOT FIND US". To the west the bridge leads to a sidewalk and that runs alongside what should be an avenue but is instead a dead drop-off of a thousand feet.,0,0,0,1
